Existing base Repository: Come-on-and-reveal-your-daily-horoscope-!

This repository is a Python-based prototype to match user with a horoscope prediction based on their horoscope. This repository will serve as my base due to the matchmaking code already created. The app is build with Flask, HTML/CSS, and JSON data storage.

MatchBox will:
- Run on Flask as a web application.
- gather input from user for classification (name, completed the personality test?, personality archetype)
- integrate personality library with 16 personality archetypes and their respective traits in a relationship. 
- Use the Meyers Briggs Personality quiz to find 3 ideal matches based on compatibility.
- Includes python files for matching logic and storage of user profiles.
- stores user data locally in JSON formatting.

Sprint 2 Task List:

- implement personality library to classify users. DONE
- make sure user data storage is easily accessible and retreivable. DONE
- make sure user profiles save for future users. DONE
- make user interface easier to operate. DoNE

Sprint 2 deliverables:
 Installed and tested a personality library for MBTI classification.

 Created user profile structure (name, MBTI type, test completion).

 Developed the program logic to classify the user’s MBTI type.

 Removed “3 match results” design and replaced it with single ideal match type logic.

 Built a compatibility dictionary mapping each MBTI type → ideal match type.

 Updated JSON storage to save user profiles for future sessions.

 Improved Flask input flow (user → classification → ideal match result).

 Added meaningful commit messages documenting every significant change.

Sprint 3 To-Do list:

Validate user input to prevent invalid or blank personality submissions.

Improve formatting of match results on the HTML page.

Add additional relationship traits to refine ideal match recommendations.

Add more meaningful test profiles for validation.
