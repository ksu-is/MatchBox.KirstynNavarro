Existing base Repository: Come-on-and-reveal-your-daily-horoscope-!

This repository is a Python-based prototype to match user with a horoscope prediction based on their horoscope. This repository will serve as my base due to the matchmaking code already created. The app is build with Flask, HTML/CSS, and JSON data storage.

MatchBox will:
- Run on Flask as a web application.
- gather input from user for classification (name, completed the personality test?, personality archetype)
- integrate personality library with 16 personality archetypes and their respective traits in a relationship. 
- Use the Meyers Briggs Personality quiz to find 3 ideal matches based on compatibility.
- Includes python files for matching logic and storage of user profiles.
- stores user data locally in JSON formatting.

Sprint 2 Task List:

- implement personality library to classify users.
- design a matching program to measure "compatibility score" with other users.
- make sure user data storage is easily accessible and retreivable.
- make sure user profiles save for future users.
- make user interface easier to operate.
